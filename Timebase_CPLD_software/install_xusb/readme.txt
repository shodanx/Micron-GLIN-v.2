Running the cable installer:

NOTE: Administrator privileges are requried to perform some of the steps
      described here.

1. Disconnect all Xilinx USB cables from the host computer.

2. Extract the contents of the ZIP file. 

3. The extraction creates a folder named install_xusb. Open this folder and 
   double-click on install_xusb.bat to start the installation. While the installer 
   is running, a DOS terminal window opens and displays installation status messages. 
   Warning messages can be safely ignored.

   Caution! Do not attempt to close this terminal window while the installer is running.

3. (Windows Vista only) While the installer is running, a Windows Security dialog box
   may appear. In this case, check the box next to Always trust software from "Xilinx" 
   and then click [Install].

4. When the installation is complete, connect the Xilinx USB cable to the desired USB
   port.
   
   (Windows XP Professional) Follow the Found New Hardware wizard when it appears.

   (Windows Vista or Windows Professional 2000) Installation is complete and no other
   actions are required.

   If the STATUS indicator on the cable illuminates, then the driver installation completed
   successfully.
